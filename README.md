# NFT Lending Protocol

## Project Description

The NFT Lending Protocol is a decentralized collateralized lending platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. This protocol enables NFT holders to unlock the liquidity of their digital assets by using them as collateral to borrow STX tokens. The platform provides a secure, transparent, and efficient way for users to access immediate liquidity without having to sell their valuable NFTs.

Key features include:
- **Collateralized Lending**: Use NFTs as collateral to borrow STX tokens
- **Loan-to-Value Ratio**: Borrow up to 70% of the NFT's assessed value
- **Secure Asset Management**: Smart contract holds NFT collateral safely during loan period
- **Flexible Repayment**: Borrowers can repay loans and retrieve their NFTs at any time
- **Transparent Operations**: All loan data and transactions are recorded on-chain

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem that bridges the gap between NFT ownership and liquid capital. We aim to:

- **Democratize Access to Liquidity**: Enable NFT holders to access immediate funds without sacrificing ownership of their digital assets
- **Foster NFT Market Growth**: By providing liquidity solutions, we encourage more participation in the NFT ecosystem
- **Build Trust Through Transparency**: Utilize blockchain technology to ensure all transactions are verifiable and secure
- **Create Sustainable Lending**: Establish a self-sustaining protocol that benefits both borrowers and the broader DeFi community
- **Promote Financial Inclusion**: Provide alternative financing options for creators, collectors, and investors in the digital asset space
